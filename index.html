      <p id="p1">My name is Edric, and I am a student at The Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extention. I enjoy PC gaming, and love to geek out about hardware. I have built multiple gaming desktops over the years and have gotten to know computer hardware quite well. I love being on computers, and am very passionate about them. I am very excited to be a student at The Coding Bootcamp and am loving to get to know how software functions. I also enjoy reading and the great outdoors.
